Multilevel Modeling Insights
Your assignment is to create a helpful tool that illustrates an important aspect of understanding and use of multilevel models. This tool could be an interesting visualization, a Shiny app, or just an extraordinarily clear example illustration/mini-lecture! This is very open-ended so be as creative as possible!

Upload a pdf document (not to exceed 3 pages) describing the following.

Concept your tool is designed to illustrate;
Method by which this concept is illustrated (e.g., describing the functionality of a Shiny app or type of content delivered);
Any relevant references important to development of your tool.
The pdf MUST also contain a link to your tool, if you have one. If you do not have a link, upload a zipped folder containing the files for said tool.

Grades will be based on the clarity and accuracy of the information delivered by the tool, relevance of the information to understanding multilevel models, and quality/professionalism of the tool developed.
